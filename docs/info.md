## How it Works

**Work in Progress**

Proof-of-concept design to test the analog design flow.  
  
Still work in progress,  
using [Old Stuff from Telluride 2021](https://github.com/tatzelbrumm/sky130_TAC3)
  
Will get filled up with other stuff as time/process availability allows.

## How to test

First of all, test the integration of the design into the TinyTapeout die.  
  
If I don't get around to add some buffer amplifiers, I'm going to need nanoamperemeters (and a low leakage current PCB setup) to get out useful information about the bias currents.

## External hardware

Instrumentation amplifiers, in particular for nA range currents.
